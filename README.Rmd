R package for "Frady, G., Dey, D.K. and Mohammed, S., 2023. Gaussian and Diffused-gamma Feature Extraction Applied to Sparse, High Dimensional Spatio-Temporal Data by Local Modeling." 

Code to perform estimation, feature extraction, and prediction under the GD prior structure.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gdprior like so:

``` r
# install the package (devtools required)
if(!require(devtools)) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('garrett-frady/gdprior')
library(gdprior)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(gdprior)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
